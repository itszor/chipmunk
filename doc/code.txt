Data-dependent code
===================

Compression (Huffman inner loop)
DCT? (MPEG, JPEG)
Lexers/parsers
Compiler optimisation passes
Sorting (which algorithms?)
AI routines? A* search?


Pack/unpack-heavy code
======================

Software FP (CSE)
Various colour mixing ops, perhaps
OpenGL code?


OO code:

Java/C++ non-inline method calls
 - inside loops
 - inside switches
 - virtual calls more interesting - not much used atm because of speed hit
 - C++ iterators?
Can we get gecko working?
